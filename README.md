### Hi there, I'm Gavin

I am a developer based in New York. Beyond my day job, I contribute to open-source projects related to Kubernetes, containerization and DevOps. Some of my notable contributions are:

* Podman - Added a flag to override container and pod hosts file. Fixed Docker API compatibility with network aliases. [1]
* Prometheus - Added public IP address to discovered Azure machines. [2]
* Node exporter - Added watchdog and XFRM monitoring modules. [3], [4]
* Sealed Secrets - Added functionality to create immutable secrets. [5]
