### Hi there, I'm Gavin

I am a full-stack developer based in New York, with a keen interest in Kubernetes, cloud computing, monitoring solutions, and DevOps.

Currently, I am contributing to projects including Podman, Prometheus, and Sealed Secrets, introducing new features and implementing fixes.

#### Containerization and monitoring

* Podman - added container level hosts file configuration and fixed Docker API compatibility with network aliases
* Prometheus - fixed public IP address discovery in Azure service discovery module
* Node exporter - added XFRM monitoring module
* Sealed Secrets - added functionality to create immutable secrets

#### Other notable contributions

* Uberdeps - added Multi-Release JAR building capability to the Clojure JAR builder library
* Geni - added capability to create fields of struct array dataframe to the Clojure dataframe library that runs on Apache Spark
