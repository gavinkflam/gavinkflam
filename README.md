### Hi there, I'm Gavin

I am a full-stack developer based in New York, with a keen interest in Kubernetes, cloud computing, monitoring solutions, and DevOps.

Outside work, I contribute to open-source projects including Podman, Prometheus, and Sealed Secrets.

* Podman - added container level hosts file configuration and fixed Docker API compatibility with network aliases.
* Prometheus - fixed public IP address discovery in Azure service discovery module.
* Node exporter - added XFRM monitoring module.
* Sealed Secrets - added functionality to create immutable secrets.

#### Other libraries

* Uberdeps - added Multi-Release JAR building capability to the Clojure JAR builder library.
* Geni - added functionality to create struct array dataframe to the Clojure dataframe library.
