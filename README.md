### Hi there, I'm Gavin

I am a software engineer based in New York. Beyond my full-time role, I actively contribute to open-source projects focused on Kubernetes, containerization and monitoring. Some of my notable contributions include:

* Podman: Implemented new flags for overriding hosts file and resolved network alias issues in Docker API. [1]
* Kubernetes: Extended system monitoring role to allow access to kubelet metrics endpoints. [2]
* CRI-O: Added HugeTLB metrics [3]
* Prometheus: Enhanced Azure service discovery by adding public IP address detection. [4]
* Node Exporter: Developed new modules for watchdog and XFRM monitoring. [5], [6]
* Kubernetes ingress2gateway: Implemented conversion of ingress backends with named ports. [7]
* Envoy Gateway: Improved HTTP route, client traffic policy and security policy with validations. [8]
* Sealed Secrets: Added functionality to create immutable secrets for improved security. [9]
