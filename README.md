### Hi there, I'm Gavin

I am a full-stack developer based in New York. In my free time, I contribute to open-source projects related to Kubernetes, containerization and DevOps.

* Podman - added container level hosts file configuration and fixed Docker API compatibility with network aliases. [1]
* Prometheus - fixed public IP address discovery in Azure service discovery module. [2]
* Node exporter - added watchdog and XFRM monitoring modules. [3], [4]
* Sealed Secrets - added functionality to create immutable secrets. [5]
